h3. Updating from SEO Lite

To update a site using SEO Lite to MODL Meta, you need to update the version of SEO Lite to between 1.2.4 - 1.3.4. (NOTE TO SELF - Add a tag or branch link to this version so we have a copy) Then follow the following steps:

* Backup the _exp_seolite_config_ and _exp_seolite_content_ tables.
* Through CP, remove the SEO Lite Module
* Import backed up _exp_seolite_config_ and _exp_seolite_content_ tables into your EE database manually.
* Install MODL Meta. Install will update table names and field names as needed maintaining all previous data at time of backup.
* Update default config.
* Update template tags.

h2. About SEO Lite & Credit

As noted above, MODL Meta was forked from SEO Lite at v1.3.4 to explore adding Open Graph tags to the solution. Our approach was specific to our needs and was not in line with the direction of SEO Lite at the time. As such, we decided to build off of v1.3.4's core of functionality that we had grown to be great fans of, and evolve it and maintain it as MODL Meta. We would encourage any EE developers interested in a great, simple and powerful SEO solution to check out SEO Lite. The following are links shared out of respect and courtesy to SEO Lite.
